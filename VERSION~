We use semantic versioning:
First number: Major version. Incremented for a commit on master that requires a change in how the pipeline is operated.
Second number: Minor version. Incremented for a commit on master that adds a new feature (usually a new command-line option).
Third number: Patch version. Incremented for anything smaller on master.
Hyphenated string: Pre-release version. Incremented for any commit on a non-master branch.
